  Guilherme earned his PhD in November 2025 and researches genetic programming and
  its applications in the health sciences. His works include developing methods for
  symbolic regression, applying machine learning to fMRI data, and advancing
  explainable artificial intelligence applications.

  He is currently interested in evolutionary computing, interpretability in machine 
  learning, optimization methods for symbolic regression, and computational models 
  of neural information processing.
