  Guilherme is a PhD candidate (expected defense date in January 2026) and 
  researches genetic programming and applications for health sciences. His 
  works include developing methods for symbolic regression, machine learning 
  applied to fMRI data, and explainable artificial intelligence.

  He is currently interested in evolutionary computing, interpretability in machine 
  learning, optimization methods for symbolic regression, and computational models 
  of neural information processing.
